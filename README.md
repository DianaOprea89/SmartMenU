To start this project, you need to run a npm install in order to install all dependencies and after that you need to open three terminals:

One for the frontend in the "front-end" folder, using the command "npm start."
One for the backend in the "back-end" folder, also using "npm start."
Another terminal in the "back-end" folder is needed to start our database with the command "mongod." Make sure to connect to MongoDB Compass so that you can access your database.
